## SOLUTIONS
1. What are the hot zones of terrorism globally?
```SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS number_of_attacks
   FROM event 
   WHERE event.success= 'Yes' -- Consider only successful attacks
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

2.  What are the Top 5 countries with terrorist attacks, including total deaths and total injured from these countries
```SELECT l.country, 
      COUNT(*) AS total_attacks, 
      SUM(no_killed) AS total_deaths, 
      SUM(no_injured) AS total_injured
   FROM location AS l
   JOIN event e ON l.country_id = e.country_id
   WHERE e.success = 'Yes' AND (e.crit_1 = 'Yes' OR e.crit_2 = 'Yes')-- Consider only successful attacks
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 2 DESC
   LIMIT 5;
```

3. Which weapons were used the most during the attacks?
```SELECT w.weapon_type, COUNT(*) AS no_of_attacks
   FROM event e
   JOIN weapon w ON e.weapon_type_id = w.weapon_type_id
   WHERE weapon
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 2 DESC
   LIMIT 5;
```

4. What is the trend for Number of terrorist attacks overtime?
 ```SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS total_attacks
    FROM event
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 1;
 ```
 
 5. What was the most common attack type in successful terrorist attacks?
 ```SELECT a.attk_type, COUNT(*) As count_of_attacks
    FROM event e
    JOIN attack a ON e.attk_type_id = a.attk_type_id
    WHERE success = ‘Yes’ --Consider only successful attacks
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 2 DESC
    LIMIT 5;
 ```
 
 6. Why is any particular attack type used the most? What is the success rate of these attack types?
 ```WITH sub AS 
    (
	  SELECT attk_type, 
		CASE WHEN success = 'No' THEN COUNT('No') ELSE 0 END AS tot_No,   --Counting total number of No
		CASE WHEN success = 'Yes' THEN COUNT('Yes') ELSE 0 END AS tot_yes --Counting total number of Yes
	  FROM event 
	  GROUP BY attk_type, success
    ),
    sub2 AS 
    (
	  SELECT DISTINCT attk_type, COUNT(*) tot_attks
	  FROM event
	  GROUP BY attk_type
    )
        SELECT DISTINCT sub2.attk_type, ROUND(sub.tot_yes::numeric / sub2.tot_attks::numeric, 2) AS attk_success_rate
        FROM sub
        JOIN sub2 ON sub.attk_type = sub2.attk_type
        WHERE tot_yes <> 0
        GROUP BY sub2.attk_type, sub.tot_yes, sub2.tot_attks
        ORDER BY attk_success_rate DESC;  
```

7. Which Group of people are targeted the Most?
```SELECT t.targt_type, COUNT(*) AS no_of_attks
   FROM event e
   JOIN target t ON e.targt_type_id=t.targt_type_id
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 2 DESC
   LIMIT 5;
```

8. Which terrorist groups have contributed to the most attacks, and how much did they contribute 
```SELECT group_name, COUNT(*) AS no_of_attks, SUM(no_killed) AS total_deaths, SUM(no_injured) AS total_injuries
   FROM event
   WHERE success = 'Yes' AND group_name <> ‘Unknown’ --Showing only those actual known 'named' groups
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 2 DESC
   LIMIT 6;
```

9. What is the no of casualities based on each attack type? Which attk type has contribute most to casuality?
```SELECT a.attk_type, SUM(e.no_casuality) AS total_casualities
   FROM event e
   JOIN attack a USING (attk_type_id)
   WHERE success = 'Yes' AND no_casuality IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 2 DESC
   LIMIT 5;
```

10. What is the trend of attacks over the years?
```SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS total_attacks
   FROM event
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 1;
```
